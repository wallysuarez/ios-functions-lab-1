## Question 1   ✔︎

Complete the function so that it will print out total cost after tax. Make sure to **call the function** afterwards.

```swift
let itemCost = 45.0
let nyTax = 0.08775

func totalWithTax() {
    let tax = (itemCost * nyTax)
    let total = (itemCost + tax)
    print("Total after NY sales tax is \(total)")
}
totalWithTax()
```

Then, modify the function you implemented to have a return type of `Int`, and use an external name that looks more readable. Function calls should look something like "total cost of the item after tax"

## Question 2   ✔︎ 

Convert the the following if/else statement below into function with a `String` return type.

```swift
let todaysTemperature = 72

if todaysTemperature <= 40 {
    print("It's cold out.")
} else if todaysTemperature >= 85 {
    print("It's really warm.")
} else {
    print("Weather is moderate.")
}
```
```swift
func todaysTempCheck(temp: Int) -> String {
    if todaysTemperature <= 40 {
        return ("It's cold out.")
    } else if todaysTemperature >= 85 {
        return ("It's really warm.")
    } else {
        return ("Weather is moderate.")
    }
}
print(todaysTempCheck(temp: todaysTemperature))
```


## Question 3   ✔︎

Write a function named `min2` that takes two `Int` values, `a` and `b`, and returns the smallest one.

Function Definition
`func min2(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int`

Example:
Input: `min2(a:1, b:2)`

Output: `1`


```swift
var smallestNum = 0

func min2(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    if a < b {
    smallestNum = a
    } else {
        if a > b {
        smallestNum = b
        }
    }
return smallestNum
}
print(min2(a: 1, b: 2))
```

## Question 4

Write a function that takes an `Int` and returns its last digit. Name the function `lastDigit`. Use _ to ignore the external parameter name.

Function Definition:
`func lastDigit(_ number: Int) -> Int`

Example:
Input: `lastDigit(12345)`

Output: `5`

```swift


```
## Question 5   ✔︎

Write a function that takes in any two positive integers and return the sum.
```swift
func sumOfTwoInts(a:Int, b:Int) -> Int {
    let sum = a + b
    return sum
}
print(sumOfTwoInts(a: 8, b: 9))
```

## Question 6

Write a function takes in any number grade and returns a corresponding letter grade.

| Number Grade | Equivalent Letter Grade |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| 100 | A+ |
| 90 - 99 | A |
| 80 - 89 | B |
| 70 - 79 | C |
| 65 - 69 | D |
| Below 65 | F |

```swift


```
## Question 7

Make a calculator function that takes in three parameters (two numbers and one operator) and returns the answer of the operation.

Operator parameter: (+, -, x, /)

```swift


```
## Question 8   ✔︎

Write a function so that it will print out **total cost after tip.**

```swift
let mealCost = 45
let tipPercentage = 0.15

//Write your code below

let mealCostDub = 45.00

func totalWithTip() -> Double {
    return mealCostDub + (mealCostDub * tipPercentage)
}
let myFinalCost = totalWithTip()
print(myFinalCost)
```

Write a function that will print out **total cost after tip and tax.**

```swift
let taxPercentage = 0.09

//Write your code below

func totalWithTipAndTax() -> Double {
    let tax = (mealCostDub * taxPercentage)
    let tip = (mealCostDub * tipPercentage)
    let finalMealCost = (mealCostDub + tax + tip)
    return finalMealCost
}
let myFinalCostWithTipAndTax = totalWithTipAndTax()
print(myFinalCostWithTipAndTax)
```


## Question 9

Implement a function named `repeatPrint` that takes a string `message` and a integer `count` as parameters. The function should print `message` `count` number of times and then print a newline.

Example:
Input: `repeatPrint(message: "+", count: 10)`

Output: `++++++++++`

```swift


```
## Question 10

Write a function named `first` that takes an Int named n and returns an array with the first n numbers starting from 1.

Function Definition
`func first(_ n: Int) -> [Int]`

Example:
Input: `first(3)`

Output: `[1, 2, 3]`

```swift


```
## Question 11

Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to x, except:

If the number if a multiple of 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 5, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, print `"FizzBuzz"` instead of the number
Your function should take in one parameter: x (the number to count up to)

```swift


```
## Question 12

```swift


```
## Question 16

## Question 18

Write a function takes an `Int` as input, and returns true if it is even, or false if it is odd.
Using your new function, write code that prints out whether `dieRoll` is even or odd:

`let dieRoll = Int(arc4random_uniform(6) + 1)`

```swift


```
## Question 19

Write a function that takes `[Int]` as input. It should return the largest Int in the array.

Using your function from the first step, use String interpolation to print a sentence that states what the largest Int in `myArray` is.

`let myArray = [3,5,1,3,532,1,4,91,20,30,92,143]`

If you haven't already done so, write a function that takes in an Int and returns whether that number is even or odd. Use that function to print a sentence that states whether the largest Int in `myArray` is even or odd.

```swift


```
## Question 20

Write a function that takes a String as input and returns the number of characters in the string

Using your function, print how many characters are in myString:

let targetCharacter: Character = "i"
```

Sample output: `3`

```swift


```
## Question 22

Example:
Input:
```swift
let inputString = "This one is a little more complicated"
let targetCharacters: [Character] = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
```

Output: `13`

```swift


```
## Question 23

Example:
Input: `let inputArray2 = [3,1,4,1,3,2,6,1,9]`

Output: `4`

//Explanation: 2, 4, 6, 9 are unique in the array. Every other number is not unique.

```swift


```
## Question 24

Example:
Input: `let binaryArray = [1,0,1,1,1,0,1]`

Output: `93`
```swift


```
## Question 25

Write a function named `timeDifference`. It takes as input four numbers that represent two times in a day and returns the difference in minutes between them. The first two parameters `firstHour` and `firstMinute` represent the hour and minute of the first time. The last two `secondHour` and `secondMinute` represent the hour and minute of the second time. All parameters should have external parameter names with the same name as the local ones.

Example:
Input: `timeDifference(firstHour: 12, firstMinute: 3, secondHour: 13, secondMinute: 10)`

Output: `67`

```swift


```

Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`

```swift


```
## Question 27

Write a function called `doubleIt` that takes an array of ints and returns it with all the elements doubled.

Example:
Input: `doubleIt(arr: [1, 2, 3, 4])`

Output: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`


Then write a function called `multiplyBy` that takes an array of ints and an int n that will return the array with all the elements multiplied by n.

Example:
Input:  `multiplyIt(arr: [1, 2, 3, 4], n: 4)`

Output:  `[4, 8, 12, 16]`

```swift


```
## Question 28

Write a function called `unwrap` that takes an array of optional ints and returns an array with them unwrapped with any nil values removed.

Example:
Input:  `unwrap(arr: [nil, 7, 4, nil, 43, 11, nil, 2])`

Output: `[7, 4, 43, 11, 2]`

```swift


```
